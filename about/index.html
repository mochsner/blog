<span class="blurb">
  I was born in Switzerland, then moved to Hilton Head in August of 2000 with my brother (Tim) & mom (Susan). I grew up on Hilton Head Island & my brother/I spent our summer/winter vacations visting our dad in Switzerland (or wherever else he lived).
  Eventually, I left Hilton Head to attend my mother's alma mater (University of South Carolina). I considered an array of engineering focused careers, but ultiamtely graduated with a degree in Operations & Supply Chain with a minor in Computer Science (Decision Support Systems).
  I've held internships at Schneider Electric & Salient CRGT in Columbia, but recently moved up to Madison WI to work as a Systems Engineer at Epic.
