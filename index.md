### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹
Glad to have you join me, I'm Marc, and this is my humble blog / static website. 

Honestly, there's not a whole lot going on here, but it's a little space where I can link out to other things that interest me, or just put some thoughts out there. If you've landed here for professional reasons, checkout my experiences tab.

My interests can range widely, but they tend to be technology focused. I'm an adamant believer that we all should be playing a part in making the world a better place, and while I'm not the _best_ at doing so, I promise to try my best.

You can also find me on [Mastodon](https://mstdn.social/@mochsner), [GitHub]((https://github.com/mochsner)), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marcochsner/), and [StackOverflow](https://stackexchange.com/users/7913208/mochsner))
