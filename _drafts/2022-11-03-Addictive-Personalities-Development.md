I have an addictive personality. Which means that my mind is constantly seeking endorphin rushes, consciously or not. I've been thinking about how software development does, and doesn't, at times mesh with addictive personality types, depending on the scenario.

To me, software development is an obsession. At all levels, for all industries, software can make our lives easier, and it really does. I tend to think about it 24/7, because I tell myself that I constantly want to improve things and streamline life. This may or may not be true - I do not know. What I do know, is that when my life contains something else that gives a larger endorphin rush, I am a sub-par developer. I don't do good work, as I am not thinking about it 24/7. 

The environment of my upbringing, as well as possibly genetics, both played a part in this obsession, but it's also something that I think developed in mid to late childhood. Growing up, I played a few online games, including Runescape, and then later World of Warcraft. Both games have a sense of achievement from general tasks (with rewards), as well as random rewards. This latter, where you're essentially gambling time for rewards, is a micro-addiction baked into the game. This sends a spike of dopamine and makes you feel good every couple minutes, though maybe only for a short while. Then, there are also endorphins released after achieving something on a more macro-level, such as reaching a certain level in a skill that's taken days or weeks to complete.

In software development, it's very similar. In general, you have a macro level goal of something you want to achieve. Then you have the micro level rewards for little baby steps towards it. For example, I might want to ship a feature that involves adding a new table to a database, handling the new mappings to that table, displaying that to the end-user, and give the end-user an ability to edit it. There's an element of luck in it, where you don't know how hard something's going to be until you do it, then you discover some new feature of a framework in doing so, which is the reward. Then, once all features are said and done, you get your macro reward.

The problem, with this personality type and software development, is when you have a personality type, but that cue/reward mechanism is replaced by something else. For example, I have an addictive personality, and channel that towards software development. Well, when I first learned coding, I had other "addictions" that were my focus, so I wasn't very successful at it. During the day, I thought about games all the time. I thought about beers. I thought about indulging in... well, whatever.

Now, I think about software. And it's my favorite way of existing.
