I grew up around technology, and have had a Facebook since 2008 - I was in middle school and made one with my brother Tim. Through Facebook and other technologies (largely games and internet forums), I basically grew up on the internet. Facebook was always weird, because it was a the intersection of "internet" and real life. And I learned a lot from it. I went on to grow a great interest in Computer Science later in life
