Hi friends!

I've decided to write about the different types of software development, since something I myself might benefit from writing out (I'm better at writing things out than talking about them verbally). The software world is a rapidly shifting industry, and everywhere you read, you only get a little bit of the overall picture. I can't write anything all encompassing, but I hope to be able to help paint that picture about how the industry of software development works, and who's involved in it.

Custom and extensible software is embedded in so many industries and profession types today, so the job descriptions for "developers"  you read about aren't even necessarily fully encompassing. THere are plenty of non-typical professionals who still use, and develop software in their profession.

For example, a systems administrator at your school might do some software development (or "scripting" when it's more single task oriented), and I'd consider them to be developers of a sort. S

Similarly, an analyst can do a variety of things with different types of programs  (i.e. Tableau, Excel, Epic in Healthcare), but to be successful, they often need to extend beyond the core functions of the program or medium they're working in. If that's in Excel, they'd use Microsoft's language called Visual Basic for Applications, or even Python if they're working with huge amounts of data. Similarly for the other programs, they allow extending things into being programmable by exporting things into standard formats, to then be processed in a program. Popular formats to help extend things from programs into something more custom development capable are:
- Comma separated value files
- JSON (formatted files)
- SQL
- XML (like JSON but older)

their cell based formulas might get complex enough, and they might need to dive into some "Visual Basic for Applications" (like my wife Ann-Marie) to get the job done. That's development, too.

Lastly,

1. Frontend Development
Frontend developers work on the part of the product with which the user interacts. They are primarily concerned with the user interface (UI). For example, they might create the layout, visual aspects, and interactive elements of a website or app. However, their role isn’t identical to that of a UI or user experience (UX) designer. They also fix bugs and make certain that the UI can run on different browsers.

They must be highly proficient in programming and work closely with the backend developers to ensure that the two aspects of the product function cohesively. 

 

2. Backend Development
In contrast, a backend developer works with the part of the product users can’t see — the back end. This professional builds the infrastructure that powers the website, app, or program, focusing on functionality, integration of systems, and core logic. They will also deal with the complex, underlying structure, ensuring strong performance, scalability, and security.

As we mentioned above, the frontend and backend developers work closely together to create a final product.

 

3. Full-Stack Development
A full-stack developer works on all aspects of the product, including both the front and back ends. To be a successful full-stack developer, you must have strong programming skills, as well as a variety of soft skills that all tech professionals must have, such as problem-solving and critical thinking. At the end of the day, you — and perhaps your team — are responsible for creating a full, complete product.

 

4. Desktop Development
Desktop developers exclusively create applications that run on a desktop operating system, such as Windows, Mac, or Linux. This is opposed to developers that create applications that run on mobile, tablet, or other devices.

This type of specialization was more ubiquitous in the early days of programming, back before the days of mobile applications. However, they still have a place in today’s landscape.

 

5. Web Development
Web development is the process of building web applications. People use these apps through an internet browser on a multitude of devices. This is different from a mobile app, which runs on a phone or tablet and doesn’t necessarily require an internet connection to run.

Web development is an umbrella term encompassing both front and backend development. Professionals can also be full-stack web developers.

 

6. Database Development
Not to be confused with a database administrator, who typically works with daily database upkeep and troubleshooting and implements the system, a database developer is responsible for building the database, modifying and designing existing or new programs, and ensuring that they satisfy the requirements of the users. Sometimes, the roles of database administrator and developer do overlap — this depends on the needs of the client or employer.

 

7. Mobile Development
As is probably obvious from the name, a mobile developer builds applications that run natively on mobile devices, including smartphones, tablets, and some types of smartwatches. Usually, these professionals will specialize in either iOS or Android development but not both. 

It is possible to work with the two operating systems. However, many companies will work with developers who are experts in just one. That’s because they tend to be more knowledgeable about the intricacies of each type of development than those who dabble in both of them since the tools, frameworks, and languages tend to be different.

 

8. Cloud Computing
Cloud computing encompasses services, programs, and applications that run over the cloud. That means they can be accessed remotely from practically any location, provided the user has an internet connection and an appropriate login. They offer plenty of advantages, including scalability. 

Some developers specialize in cloud computing — that is, the creation of cloud platforms. They will build cloud applications and facilitate cloud deployment and migration, as well as manage cloud services and provide maintenance to users. 

 

9. DevOps Engineering
DevOps is a set of practices and philosophies that are focused on the quick, efficient, and customer-centric delivery of software. Related to Agile, this style has been widely adopted by software developers and teams around the world.

DevOps engineers work with teams that practice the principles. They participate not only in the development of the product at hand but also in quality assurance (QA) testing and eventual deployment. They must possess a wide range of skills, such as programming, integration, scripting, QA testing, and more. They also need to blend theory and practice to support and work with the rest of the team, which may include software developers and QA professionals.

 

10. Security Engineering
Everyone knows how important security in software is in this day and age. Security software professionals are dedicated to ensuring the security of various technological systems. They must have extensive knowledge of the methodology, practices, tools, and patterns cybercriminals employ to hack software so they can help prevent these attacks from taking place.

Ethical hackers are one example of this type of professional. They work with clients to attempt hack software in order to pinpoint and expose vulnerabilities, allowing them to patch them before they are exploited by cybercriminals.

This is by no means a comprehensive list of all the types of software development — the field is wide and varied. However, these are still some of the most important types you should understand when looking to hire developers and development teams to work on your next project — and build a high-quality product.
