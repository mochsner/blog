Whilst I'm a software engineer in practice, I'm an engineer at heart, and I've really wanted to learn more about the physical aspects of engineering recently - particularly so as I grow older and have more opportunities to work with physical things, such as circuits, in my life.

So, whilst I don't have a conventional engineering background like my brother (i.e. Intro to Circuits), I figure I can still learn enough to do some basic things, so long as I familiarize myself with the tools of the trade, and keep them around the house to work with. I have the basic foundations, but the conversions don't seem to stick very well.

Looking online, I decided to look into what I need to learn and play with circuits, and play with some numbers so that I'll be able to do the conversions in my head. Electronics is something I feel the need to be able to talk through colloquially, so I need that hands on experience.

Where to buy components (list including Amazon, Adafruit, Sparkfun, etc) - basically radioshack equivalents online: [](https://www.build-electronic-circuits.com/buy-electronic-components/)

That links to this [](https://www.build-electronic-circuits.com/electronic-components-online/), a summary of the electronic components, which are hard to find, and what I need to buy, what packages include, etc.

It even talks about breadboards (great for learning): [](https://www.build-electronic-circuits.com/breadboard/)
