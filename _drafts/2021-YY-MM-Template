As a software engineer, it's my mindset to break things down, understand them, and use that knowledge to bring value to things. In my workflow as a developer, I use a desk a lot. In particular, I use my [Ikea Skarsta]() a lot. It's a nifty little hand crank standing table, and it does the job just fine.

I've wanted a fully automated standing desk for a while, but I can't really justify the waste of throwing away or getting rid of this table that has served me well for the past 3 years. I also can't really justify spending the money on top of that.

What I can justify, is spending the time and effort to improve my current desk, and learn a thing or two along the way. I found an article a while ago, where I can turn my Skarsta into a fully automated standing desk, and it's pretty nifty.

Unfortunately, it requires a 3D printer, so I haven't been able to make one. Well, a 3D printer feels like a much better investment as an engineer than another desk. So... (TO BE CONTINUED AFTER OBTAINING 3D PRINTER)
