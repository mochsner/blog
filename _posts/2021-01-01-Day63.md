Hi folks!

Happy new years! It's quite an exciting year we have coming up (at least for me and my family) here in 2021. I'm looking forward to being able to use this year to continue to grow my skills as a developer, integrated into my current life as a husband, and soon to be life as a father.

Today, I decided to take a break from the exciting stuff I've got going at work, as I wanted to make a post about 2021 for my social feeds, but wanted to disclude it from my normal blog posts so that the sentimental stuff wouldn't really show up much. I figured out how to get the post itself working, and have the *previous* and *next* buttons avoiding the different categories of posts, which is cool. You'll notice, that if you go to the previous post from here, that it doesn't point you to a *long* [post]({{site.url}}/social/anexciting2020) about my reflections on 2021 as a human being.

If you navigate to {{site.url}}/posts, you'll find that you can see the post there, titled "2020: A Great Year". Tomorrow, I'll be working on a way to separate out that list, so that you can browse my posts by category.

Happy coding, and happy new year!
