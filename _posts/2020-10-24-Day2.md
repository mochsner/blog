It's the weekend, and I'm excited to be watching the keynote/intro for DevFestWi](https://devfestwi.com) with @meliss_houghton](https://melissahoughton.github.io). She spoke about Imposters syndrome, which I've definitely felt like I had in my previous role in Systems Engineering, as I was put in more of leadership roles towards the end of my 2 years at Epic. She had a great article on the matter as well, which you can check out [here](https://melissahoughton.dev/2020/02/22/impostor-syndrome.html).

During today's [talks](https://devfestwi.com/schedule/), I'm looking at the best ways to link out to hook up to development Twitter, so that any links I upload will have some sort of traceability. I got the idea from Melissa's website, which seems to do something similar using ?ref_url querystrings at the end of any twitter links. It looks fairly easy to embed tweets as well, so I may look at the idea of doing something like that down the road.

There may be a variety of other things I want to add in as well, so expect an update to this post later today!
