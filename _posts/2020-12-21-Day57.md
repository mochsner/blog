Today, I've been working on some application changes for an Azure service that's required publishing to a remote service for testing. With the many changes I'm making in C# for an API, I'm needing to trace any issues the application is running into once deployed into Microsoft Azure, so I've been using a tool called "Remote debugging" in Visual Studio, which has proven very useful.

If you're interested in remote debugging, feel free to checkout the summary [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/debugger/remote-debugging-azure?view=vs-2019). As a whole, it requires the following steps:
1. Publish your project in a debug deployment (release modes can't be debugged, as you'd probably guess)
2. Connecting Visual Studio to your Azure portal (account authentication)
3. Navigating through Azure Explorer:
   1. Services...
   2. Right Click <Service Name>
   3. Attach Debugger

It's a fairly straightforward process, but just knowing how and understanding how can be a gamechanger. If you use Azure App services at all, I'd highly recommend getting familiar with it!

Tomorrow - or later this week - I'm hoping to be able to figure out how to get remote debugging working in JetBrains Rider. The process isn't natively supported for Azure App Services, but I'm much more comfortable (and efficient) with JetBrains' products, so I'm hoping to be able to figure out the site, port, and authentication information to get that working :)

In any case, happy coding ya'll!
