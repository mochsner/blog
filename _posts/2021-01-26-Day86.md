Hi there! While I don't have anything particularly interesting to talk about, I still wanted to post about my day and how I've felt going through my work things today. Overall, I've been working in some new territory today, and have been pretty interested in it. It ties a bit to my background as a Systems Engineer, so it's nice being able to use that background a bit. Other than that, nothing really new - I'll be posting about my experience with reading and highlighting 'babywise' through Kindle highlights later this week!

Happy coding, ya'll!
