Hi folks!

Happy New Years Eve! Today, I got to work on some C# things at work, mostly finishing up some integrations that a colleague had started. 

It was a *somewhat* productive day, but I didn't really get to work on some of the parts that are most exciting to me, and I want to have done by next week. With next week's sprint starting next week at full blast, I want to make sure that I come into the week with a good note.

This weekend, I'm planning to wrap up the web related issues that I need to finish up, and then hope to spend some time familiarizing myself with Xamarin/UWP, which I've heard a lot about through the [mergeconflict.fm](mergeconflict.fm) podcast.

Happy new years, and happy Coding!
