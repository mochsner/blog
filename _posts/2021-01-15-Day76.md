Hi friends!

### Looking forward
It's FRIDAY (and one of my wife and my last weekends while weekends == relaxation)! I'm _so_ excited, because our baby's due date is February 1st, 2021 - just 16 days away. This weekend (beyond just code stuff), we're planning to start going through some of the baby stuff to bring it upstairs, as well as getting our car seat installed for that exciting moment we'll get to go home with the baby (about 3 days later). 

#### Saturday - Xamarin

Tomorrow, I'm planning to be able to acquaint myself a bit with Xamarin, as I've been getting more interested in Mobile development and think it's about time to improve my repertoire in that domain. I've listened to a lot about the technology from listening to [mergeconflict.fm](https://mergeconflict.fm), but I think it's high time that I get hands on with a simple project so that I can understand it to the best of my ability.

#### Saturday - Org Mode

I'm also hoping to be able to take a short amount of time to get re-acquainted with some sort of organization strategy. OneNote has proven very useful so far, and I may continue with it, but I want to research other options (such as emacs org mode, or vim's implementation of org mode). I have a private github project I use for this [here](https://github.com/mochsner/emacs/), and I'll likely continue to use that, but reimplemented.

#### Sunday - Web & Mobile Changes (getting ahead for work)

Next week, I'm anticipating getting more hands on with the mobile as well as web changes that I've made (as I prepare for being out for a week), so I'll also be planning to take a look at some of the work items that are needing doing on Sunday.

### Today

While there's a bit I've done at work, there's nothing very notable for a post, so I decided to make some code updates on this blog. You'll notice that the Next/Previous buttons to this post are now showing in buttons, and they're actually using `flex-box` behind the scenes, so 

```css
<div class="d-flex flex-row postinator">
  {% if previous_post %}
  <div class="page-item flex-fill" style="flex: 1 1 0;">
    <a class="page-link" style="text-align:left;" href="{{previous_post.url}}">&laquo; {{previous_post.title}}</a>
  </div>
  {% else %}
  <div class="page-item disabled flex-fill" style="flex: 1 1 0;">
    <a class="page-link" style="text-align:left" href="#">&laquo; Previous</a>
  </div>
  {% endif %}
  
  {% if next_post %}
  <div class="page-item flex-fill" style="flex: 1 1 0;">
    <a class="page-link" style="text-align:right;" href="{{next_post.url}}">{{next_post.title}} &raquo;</a>
  </div>
  {% else %}
  <div class="page-item disabled flex-fill" style="flex: 1 1 0;">
    <a class="page-link" style="text-align:right" href="#">Next &raquo;</a>
  </div>
  {% endif %}
</div>
```

That pretty much just means that it handles mobile a bit better:

Although, they're currently not perfectly aligned, so there's some room for improvement in cases like this:

I'll try to make some improvements to the CSS, and show how this can be better represented in a CSS (or better yet, SCSS) file soon!

Stay awesome & happy coding!
