Today, I've mostly been looking into AngularJS, a useful javascript framework. While I've been able to use it in the past for projects, it's always fun being able to dive back in and use tools like it (which are _much_ easier to manage long-term than frameworks like jQuery and their associated dependencies)...

You can find a fork of the Snippet I've opted to fork from the official site [here](https://codepen.io/mochsner/pen/RwRXyNg), which serves up a textbox that suggests user input based on a pre-defined list. The list, whilst not originally modifiable, can easily be altered to be changable in the source code as well.

Through-out this week, I'll be working on implementing this library in a scalable way to the Secret Santa application I'm working on with Cole, so stay tuned on any updates there as well... Happy coding!
