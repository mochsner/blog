Hi friends!

Today was a very rewarding day! I'm starting to see a light at the end of the tunnel for the testing and designs I proposed earlier, and I'll be presenting those results tomorrow. After tomorrow, I'm hoping to be able to take some time again to work on some personal development projects (whether this weekend or next). My wife and I are expecting a baby in the very start of February, so these next (2) weeks will really be the last chance I have to get any cool or interesting personal projects in.

While personal projects and development are important, I also do realize that these are our last weeks as a married couple of two for quite a while! So, with that in mind, it's very possible that my posts won't be quite as high quality as they were in the beginning of this #100DaysOfCode journey. Even so, if you've followed along with any of my journey, I appreciate you and hope you may have learned something through it (whether about me or about coding)!

Stay awesome,

MO
