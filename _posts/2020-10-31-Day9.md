Happy halloween! Today, tomorrow, and through-out the week, I will be working on redesigning some of my website. 

I'm currently looking at using angular/material, which is pretty straight forward and compatible with Jekyll pages on Github (what this blog runs on).

While I've got a ways to go, I've started drafting up some of the instructions for getting this setup, so I can transfer it to the [README.md](https://github.com/mochsner/mochsner.github.io/README.md) if that's what's decided on.

### Installing Angular + angular/material

1. Generate the app

```bash
ng new my-app-name
```

    Prompts:
    - Y for routing
    - Styles:
      - LESS: lightweight and used by bootstrap, but not very dynamic and formatting is whitespace based
      - SCSS: lightweight and flexible, most popular amongst web developers
      - Stylus: Newer framework, reliant on Node, but preferred by developers such as Wes Bos that are very front-end focused. A bit more features with skipping variables

2. Add Angular Material

    ```bash
    cd my-app-name
    ng add @angular/material
    ```
    Prompts:
    - Theme: Indigo Pink (or whichever)
    - Select `Y` for setting up global Typography styles
    - Select `Y` for animations (duh)


... I know there's still a ways to go, but my wife and I are celebrating being 99 days from Feb 7th today (our forecasted "big day"), and celebrating halloween =) Happy coding!
