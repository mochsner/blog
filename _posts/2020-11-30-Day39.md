As a continuation from yesterday, I've completed the next chapter in [AngularJS Fundamentals](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/angularjs-fundamentals/table-of-contents), the 2nd to last chapter, _Creating Custom Angular Directives_. I also got started with Testing Angular applications using Karma and Jasmine on JetBrains' WebStorm, but found that it may be a bit excessive for today and decided to put it off for tomorrow night.

In regards to my work today, I'm currently working on a project porting things over to components in AngularJS to improve reusability (a core object-oriented tenet) in our codebase. I'm working on a really tough (for me) problem on how to approach the connection between controllers and services, so here's to hoping that the rest of my night is a productive one!

Looping back, I also fixed an issue with my Google Tags, where I've found that an External Link tracker had false positives when I was clicking links on localhost/127.0.0.1 domains when testing. I was able to fix this by changing the "match" to disclude anything that matches the following Regular Expression: `https?:\/\/(mochsner\.github\.io|127\.0\.0\.1|localhost)`. Will have to wait until tomorrow to see if that worked!

Happy coding!
