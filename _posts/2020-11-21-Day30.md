It's been a long (and exciting) week, so today I actually just opted to take the day off and hangout with my wife Ann-Marie. We celebrated my 26th birthday yesterday, and I made the big mistake of too much caffeine before bed, so I just wasn't in the right mindset to code and realized that pretty early in the day.

Fortunately, I was able to listen to a. Little bit of Wes Bos' origij story, and it was really inspiring to learn a bit of his background, and how might be the best way to start making coding videos if I ever found that to be something which could be good for me.

Tomorrow is also a new day, so I'm excited to get some solid rest and tackle the day, as well as potentially work on some code stuff then!

Stay awesome & happy coding everyone!
