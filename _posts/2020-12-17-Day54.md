This past Thursday, I spent a lot of time trying to figure out some SQL migrations in the Microsoft Technology stack. I found entity framework to be a very powerful and expressive way to upgrade SQL, but I also ran into a number of issues for things that just didn't really work out that well.

In initializing, and starting to use "Code First" migrations via Entity Framework, it's really important to make sure to take a snapshot of the "current state" in Entity Framework, so that you can then build out that current state on fresh new databases.

Expanding on what I've done, it would be smart to be be able to figure out how to seed test data in Entity Framework in the method `Application_Start`. I'll definitely be looking to do this for future changes.
