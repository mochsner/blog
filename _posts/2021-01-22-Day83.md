This past Friday, I was able to work through some testing issues with my app, but really got caught up on that phase of things with deploying to the device. I definitely havne't had a lot of experience with development on remote devices (as opposed to running everything locally), so there's still some hiccups there that I'm working through. I'm hoping to be able to make some good progress on them next week, and hopefully we get the full week so that I'm able to do that (else, I'll be shifting focus to our daughter, Adora :smiley:).
