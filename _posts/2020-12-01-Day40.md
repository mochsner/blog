It's December! As we approach the new year, I made the unfortunate mistake of missing a dependency for one of my new features. Whilst it's implemented (and works), it doesn't exactly seem to mesh well with the rest of the application, that doesn't support the current version of this framework.

Tonight, I started looking into what it would require to update some of the rest of the application, and tomorrow I'll be looking into alternatives to the libray that requires these dependencies. Wish me luck & happy coding!
