Today, I've been working with AngularJS for a majority of the day, and whilst I've done a good bit of front-end development, it's definitely been a few years since I was really heavy into front-end, and my rusty usage of AngularJS definitely hasn't helped me in this case. I first got into web development in an internship starting in 2016, and I've had my fair share of discoveries and similar issues since then. Still, 4 years later, I got caught up on an issue that I wasn't able to figure out (I thought it was something I was missing with AngularJS), but it was... yep... BROWSER CACHING!

Ha, well, I'm happy to have figured it out... but man I feel like I just wasted the last few hours on nothing. Turns out, the controllers were passing the element up to the modal pop up this whole time... Anyways, sorry I don't have any more meaningful update today, but if you want to learn something, feel free to click back to go to yesterday's post :) The link is currently a bit small at the top of the blog post, but it's there I promise :smiley:

Happy coding!
