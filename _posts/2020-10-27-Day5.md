Today, I got to spend a good bit of time doing some front-end debugging, which is quite fun to do in C# once you get setup. There's definitely some caveats in how you need to run scripts, but in general it's really simple once you get setup. Hint: disable any minifiers, which port to new files and get rid of breakpoints).

In terms of personal work, it wasn't a very productive day, but I had a great time taking some time off and carving pumpkins with my wife. I feel very happy and refreshed, and learned that I'm actually pretty good at carving pumpkins! I'll be sure to share a picture if we take one on this post later (if we take one)!
