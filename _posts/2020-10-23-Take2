Hi all!

Whilst I'm not the greatest when it comes to being public about things on the internet, I've decided that I really want to document my coding and learning process, whether posting on social media every day or not, for 100 days. I want to do this as a strategy of "habit stacking", as noted in Atomic Habits (by James Clear), to do so in addition to my new exercise regime in the mornings. I'd like to thank my wife, Ann-Marie, for supporting me to make my best attempt at this self-documenting scheme of marginal gains, to help me become a better programmer.

Towards the latter end of college in my studies of Operations and Supply Chain, I've absolutely fallen in love with programming, and while I'm beyond blessed to have started as a Full Stack Developer this month, I also recognize that I have a LOT to learn, and improve upon, in order to be successful. Since I mostly work with .NET technologies (C# and AngularJS) at work, I will be talking about those experiences, and maybe even talk about mental health pertaining to development during the week.

On weekends, and days that are less busy, I'm going to be using this platform to work on my front-end skills, which are definitely something I want to improve upon. That could be completing tutorials, reading "You don't know JS", or more. Whilst I'm starting this blog with posts on social media, I may be taking breaks from social media for my own mental health, so if you'd like to keep up with my posts, please check me out at mochsner.github.io!

On the todo list by the end of 100 days, I'll plan to have an RSS feed, E-mail feed, and a MUCH better looking site. Stay tuned!
