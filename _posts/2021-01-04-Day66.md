Hi friends!

Yesterday (Day 65), I was able to work on some things Azure, where I got to work on some authentication pieces of my application to get an API working for tests / visibility. It was an interesting issue, and I'm super happy we were able to figure it out! After finalizing that, I pivoted to working with an Excel sheet & formulas for feedback on some testing I was doing. Overall, definitely a lot of day working, but think I learned a lot and made good progress!

Happy coding.
