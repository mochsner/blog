Today, I continued some more training at work, and got to spend some time on more operatinal tasks while working on some developmental research. Overall, it was a good day at work, but balanced with some _very_ interesting life events! I got to talk with my wife about pregnancy and our worries/fears for the future daughter, and really appreciated being able to take that time to do so on my lunch break.

Happy coding!
