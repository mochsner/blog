Hi friends!

Today (Day 66), I'll be working with APIs, and manipulating the data that's exposed in those APIs.

While API documentation isn't something that's directly part of my work, I'll also want to try to familiarize myself with Swagger through the [OpenAI Specification](https://swagger.io/specification/), and how it's used in .NET. Overall, I think it would be a very useful technology to make working, and testing, with APIs a bit easier.

Happy coding!
