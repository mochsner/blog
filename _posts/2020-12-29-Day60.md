Hi all!

I've been on a bit of a hiatus from these postings, as my focus has been on less open natured things, which makes it entirely hard to post about. Today, I've decided that I *do* have web things that definitely need doing, so I'm going to be starting on those things today and posting about my progress.

Today, I'll be working through some C# MVC changes, and tracing those back to AngularJS on the front-end. I'll be sure to document anything else interesting I find, though!

Happy Coding!
