Yesterday, I started looking into non angular components to use for a project, as I had discovered the night before that components I was using would not be compatible with our project. After looking around for a while and finding a number of good contestants, I decide to take a break around lunch to look into the issue again and figure out why the components weren't compatible (according to their website).

Well, after a solid night's sleep, I was actually able to figure out that they were compatible! If you're using Angular Material, you'll be able to use it with the following versions of AngularJS:

```javascript
ngMaterial 1.0 -> ngJS 1.5
ngMaterial 1.1 -> ngJS 1.6
ngMaterial 1.2 -> ngJS 1.7/1.8
```

This is in _contrast_ to what Angular Material has on their github page [here](https://github.com/angular/material).

Happy coding!
