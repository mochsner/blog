Hey folks!

So, it's looking like the next 2 days of work may be taking up a lot of time, so I wanted to get a post/update out here that I'm aware of the issue, but unable to take the time to fix it with work at the moment.

Today, I **did** get to take some time to figure out how to post from mobile, so if you're reading this - it was successful! I think this is super exciting, as it just makes posting on here just a tiny bit more accessible. 

I'm currently using two tools: 
- Markor: markdown editing on android
- Termux (with git): terminal emulator for Android

Happy Coding!
