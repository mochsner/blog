Hi folks!

So quick update for today, I was able to work on some Jekyll changes for the website where the [home]({{site.url}}) now fully loads the most recent post (sort of like a "featured post" location), then follows it up with a short excerpt from the next 4 articles. I decided to switch it to this (1) to better familiarize myself with Jekyll's capabilites, and (2) to improve load times.

I've also decided to filter out any 'social' category posts, until I decide on a better place to store those.

Happy coding!
