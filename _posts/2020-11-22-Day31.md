Today, I've decided on an approach for data binding for the Secret Santa app, which Cole and I will be implementing in AngularJS. To re-iterate from a previous post, he's working on a lot of the front-end styling, then I'll be working with translating a lot of the data into fields and inputs, as well as using Bootstrap 4 for alignment and outlines of the pages.

AngularJS is a great choice, because it's a mature framework. I've got plenty of experience with it, and while I'm rusty, it should be fairly quick to get up and running. I'm also interested in implementing Angular 2.X +, but think that starting with AngularJS will be valuable experience, because we'll then have a snapshot of the "before" vs. "after" for an app that's upgraded from JS to Typescript versions of Angular.

That's all I really have for today. Happy coding!
