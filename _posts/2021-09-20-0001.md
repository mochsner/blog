Got a little todo for myself to look into Google photos for Github pages (not natively supported, but maybe I can figure something out...)

Link to repo to work with: https://github.com/heychirag/jekyll-google-photos

Also, just setup a little website to load some basic browser resolution data. See here: {{site_url}}/0/browser-info
