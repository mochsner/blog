Hi friends!

Today, I'm going through the fun challenge of backing up my original Ubuntu workstation from college to an external drive, so that I can repurpose that harddrive to use in a Macbook that will get WAY more use out of it. It's very cool to think that this is the workstation that I really learned so much about computers through (I knew very little about Linux, but knew I wanted to use it). I hope to keep this backup and install on a computer again in the future, but for now, it's just living in backup =)
