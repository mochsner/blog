Today, Day 79, I had some interesting work stuff that I was wrapping up before our weekly meeting. On the side, I've also started looking into some Xamarin things. I'm starting to realize how useful mobile development can be (if you understand it), so I'm looking to try to get more involved with it in one way or another.

Stay awesome & happy coding!
