Today, I was largely working through some more healthcare realted work (yes, I work at a medical software company). Having working at a major Electronic Health Record company (Epic Systems) for almost 2 and a half years, it was interesting jumping back to some familiar territory, being able to use much of the experience there in what I was working on. While the work I do almost always revolves around development things (I'm a full-stack web developer), the context of the work may change from day to day, and I'm thankful to be able to work with that diverse set of issues :smiley:

Happy coding!
