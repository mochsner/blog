Today, I've started shifting gears away from web development, to another native application. It was a lot of just absorbing code and trying to wrap my head around an API, so not particularly complicated, but just a bit different than what I'm used to with browser dev tools. I'm a bit spoiled with those tools, in the web dev world!

Tomorrow, I'll be able to work on implementing some database changes. Thanks for reading :smiley:

Happy Coding!
