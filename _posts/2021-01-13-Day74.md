Hi friends!

I've been working a lot in test these past (2) weeks, and yesterday I spent some time working through a particular issue where I got to do some design work to help map out what sort of approaches will help our application.

While I don't feel comfortable speaking to the application itself, it was really interesting work because I got to use some of the knowledge of the more technical classes I took in college towards the end. The classes I added my senior year really helped to create a sort of understanding of what was possible, and what's not.

I definitely have a ways to learn in terms of our application, but I'm excited to be able to continue to work on it and help in any way possible!

Happy coding!
