Hi friends!

Today, I spent a lot of my development time working on Mobile development, with nothing very notable, but progress is definitely being made.

Beyond my core development tasks, I was pulled into a very weird issue where we're able to get some code that's running locally just fine, but having issues when pushed to the cloud. I'll be continuing the search on that front tomorrow morning, and hope to have some interesting findings from remote debuggers!
