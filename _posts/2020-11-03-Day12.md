Hi folks! Happy Election day for those living in the United States. As I start to wrap up the day, I'm realizing that I haven't really prioritized my own personal development today, but that's okay - we don't always have time for personal projects. I'll be sure to be better about it later this week to make up for it!

Even in my time off today, I've mentally committed myself to completing a code challenge to create a secret santa matcher by Nov 15th. This may detract from being able to focus on the blog, but I'm hoping to be able to re-aquaint myself with Javascript through the exercise, and maybe even add in some interesting features that allow communication or sharing of presents down the road (this would require a back-end, so probably can't be hosted on this blog).

In any case, I don't have much else in terms of updates today, so I wanted to give a shout-out to my homie [@willy_west_side](https://twitter.com/willy_west_side), who just released his newest video today on his [Youtube Channel](https://youtube.com/willywestside). If you're interested in customizing your switch, I definitely recommend checking out his new [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooAAcyrvkGQ) reviewing some customized joycons and how you might be able to do so!
