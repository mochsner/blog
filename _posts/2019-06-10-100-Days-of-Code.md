# 100 Days of Code
I've been telling myself that I'm going to spend more time coding, but it's hard to make the time for working on code when you work with computers all day. So, I'm deciding to force it upon myself to code for 100 days straight. No matter how much or how little I do, I'm going to be doing something to advance my software development skills, whether it be learning a new editor, language/framework, or architecting some infrastructure in the cloud to make use the fun stuff I'm building. 

I plan to spend most of the front half of these 100 days working on this blog, with vim to see how I can improve my workflows through it. Admittedly, I have a LONG ways to go before I'm competent enough to match my speed with other editors... either way, you can track my notes in [http://github.com/mochsner/.vim](mochsner/.vim), where I'll be documentating things that I learn, as well as files for my vim customizations. I expect to spend much of this journey just learning about vim, so apologies if there isn't enough actual "code" in this round of #100DaysOfCode.I normally use VS Code, so I'll also be using the VSCodeVim [plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscodevim.vim) as well.

Anyways, here's to an exciting (& busy) time of the year - happy coding!

| Day | Reflection |
|----------|-------------|
| **2019.06.10** _(Wed, Day 1)_ | Play the VIM game; start RSS feed for Jekyll blog; discuss code idea with Ann-Marie (calendar) |
| **2019.06.11** _(Thu, Day 2)_ | Researched RSS feed for Jekyll blog, including tags feature for share: twitter feature. |
| **2019.06.12** _(Fri, Day 3)_ | Setup / tested RSS feed for Jekyll blog, including a general social-feed template that Twitter feeds inherit from. This integration is used in conjunction with ifttt.com, where you have "if _this_ event, then _that_ action". This led to some pretty cool realizations of what ifttt can do, including publishing to google sheets, facebook messenger, Slack, Telegram, Wordpress & a huge assortment of 3rd party web services. |
| **2019.06.13** _(Sat, Day 4)_ | It's Saturday, but I'm hoping to be able to take some time later today to try to get SSL working for mochsner.io in AWS. Github's instructions seem to explain it pretty well in https://help.github.com/en/articles/troubleshooting-custom-domains#https-errors, but the GUI AWS Console was pretty confusing last time & I wasn't able to figure it out. That led me to learn of the AWS CLI, which I'm not too familiar with but want to become more comfortable with. 
<u>Follow-up</u>: Didn't actually get it working. Still can't figure out where in AWS CLI to get an A-record setup without creating the $50 monthly charge for a hosted zone (same issue I ran into last year). Still need to do a bit of digging / maybe ask around on other blogs that seem to have similar setups. Fortunately, I was able to have some fun with Linux & get VSCode & VSCodeVim installed. |
| **2019.06.14** _(Sun, Day 5) | I was able to play around with PSCore6 today, which is pretty powerful. After just a few minutes, I came to realize that you can pipe objects / information between powershell commands & linux commands, such as Grep. Not sure what the limits of this interoperability are, but I'm excited to find out! |
| **2019.06.15** _(Mon, Day 6) | I spent a good bit learning about Vim, as well as been to play with AD / Powershell a bit (which definitely makes the life of a Systems Administrator a bit easier). When dealing with multiple servers, being able to query AD can make things a bit less monotonous :) |
| **2019.06.16** _(Tue, Day 6)_ | - Simple to-do, since I'll be sleep deprived: Follow steps in [Debugging VsCode Ext](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/wiki/Building,-Debugging-and-Sideloading-the-extension-in-Visual-Studio-Code) to generate a .vsix & test if VSCodeVim will work in my VENV used at work. The more practice with Vim (even if it's just Netscaler commands & occasional Powershell), the better! Since VSCode is version 1.28.0, I've deduced the VSCode dependency to most likely be [v1.0.4 (2019-01-31)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items/vscodevim.vim/changelog).
- It's been a long day & there's little actual coding I'm doing (outside above mention), but I'm getting comfortable with VIM! Opted today to use VsCodeVim to generate some Splunk/Netscaler commands for work, which worked out pretty well (even considering time restraints & the semi-awkward middle ground that is VsCodeVim). Tomorrow, I'll look into scripting my environment to import plugins/extensions, since I'm starting to appreciate a more predictable (& responsive) experience. |
