# 100 Days of Code
I've been telling myself that I'm going to spend more time coding, but it's hard to make the time for working on code when you work with computers all day. So, I'm deciding to force it upon myself to code for 100 days straight. No matter how much or how little I do, I'm going to be doing something to advance my software development skills, whether it be learning a new editor, language/framework, or architecting some infrastructure in the cloud to make use the fun stuff I'm building. 

I plan to spend most of the front half of these 100 days working on this blog, with vim to see how I can improve my workflows through it. Admittedly, I have a LONG ways to go before I'm competent enough to match my speed with other editors... either way, you can track my notes in [http://github.com/mochsner/.vim](mochsner/.vim), where I'll be documentating things that I learn, as well as files for my vim customizations. I expect to spend much of this journey just learning about vim, so apologies if there isn't enough actual "code" in this round of #100DaysOfCode.I normally use VS Code, so I'll also be using the VSCodeVim [plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscodevim.vim) as well.

Anyways, here's to an exciting (& busy) time of the year - happy coding!
| Day   | Reflection |
|----------|:-------------:|------:|
| **2019.06.10** _(Wed)_ | Play the VIM game; start RSS feed for Jekyll blog; discuss code idea with Ann-Marie (calendar) |
| **2019.06.11** _(Thu)_ | Researched RSS feed for Jekyll blog, including tags feature for share: twitter feature. |
| **2019.06.12** _(Fri)_ | Setup / tested RSS feed for Jekyll blog, including a general social-feed template that Twitter feeds inherit from. This integration is used in conjunction with ifttt.com, where you have "if <this> event, then <that> action". This led to some pretty cool realizations of what ifttt can do, including publishing to google sheets, facebook messenger, Slack, Telegram, Wordpress & a huge assortment of 3rd party web services. |
| **2019.06.13** _(Sat)_ | It's Saturday, but I'm hoping to be able to take some time later today to try to get SSL working for mochsner.io in AWS. Github's instructions seem to explain it pretty well in https://help.github.com/en/articles/troubleshooting-custom-domains#https-errors, but the GUI AWS Console was pretty confusing last time & I wasn't able to figure it out. That led me to learn of the AWS CLI, which I'm not too familiar with but want to become more comfortable with. |
