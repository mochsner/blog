Today, I'm planning to do some .NET. Shawn Wildermuth has a great [PluralSight course](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/aspnetcore-mvc-efcore-bootstrap-angular-web/table-of-contents) on .NET Core MVC, and I'm just at the part of security, which I've historically struggled with. For some reason, there's a bug that when I log in, so I'm going to be trying to work through that before I jump over to the Angular bit.
