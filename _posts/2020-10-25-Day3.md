## Plan

Today, I had planned to do some .NET work on a [project](https://github.com/mochsner/DutchTreat/) I'd created a few weeks ago to in a tutorial. Shawn Wildermuth has a great [PluralSight course](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/aspnetcore-mvc-efcore-bootstrap-angular-web/table-of-contents) on .NET Core MVC, and there was a bug (on the front-end JS side, as well as security/auth wise) that I wanted to work through in order to make sure it's working on my current version.

## Decision

After stepping out for a while during the day, I decided that I'd be much happier if I were to be able to run this code on my personal PopOS laptop, as I've been using Linux for a while and really like the JetBrains software used for C# development. While most of my experience is in C# and the .NET (or Microsoft) side of things, I'm really passionate about open-source, so I want to be a part of the effort to help move a lot of Microsoft technologies to be hosted on Linux (which is WAY better and cheaper long-term, in terms of costs). From 2+ years of server administration in a scalable environment on the Microsoft side of things, I've just found that Windows servers aren't very good at interfacing with various technologies, such as Puppet/Ansible. That, and of course, containers are definitely nice for cloud-based solutions, to make things a bit more scalable. `

## Work

In setting things up locally, I've figured out how to install SQL locally and use it, but need to figure out how the [DutchTreat](https://github.com/mochsner/dutchtreat) repository would connect to the database differently (TODO for tomorrow).

Installing Entity Framework, SQL server, and everything was pretty seamless. Finding some of the packages was a bit of an effort, but that goes for all cases - even installing on Windows. I documented much of the process for the installs here in the Github Repo [mochsner/DutchTreat - dev-linux branch](https://github.com/mochsner/DutchTreat/tree/dev-linux).
