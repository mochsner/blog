Happy Friday!

Today was officially my first of the #100DaysOfCode challenge, and quite honestly it's been a bit of a day.

I'd stayed up a bit later than normal, so I've been fumbling to work through an issue at work, where I'm trying to connect to an Azure Blob storage block remotely, rather than locally. Whilst I haven't quite figured it out yet, it's definitely something I need to figure out going into next weekend so that I'm able to make solid progress on my real issues, so it may become a work item for me this weekend, along with attending [DevFestWi](https://devfestwi.com) at 10 AM tomorrow!

In terms of personal development early this morning, I worked on making sure that my development environments are set up on my computers, to be able to work with markdown effectively, for this blog, as well as my initiative to improve documentation at work.
