Happy Friday!

Today was officially my first of the #100DaysOfCode challenge, and quite honestly it's been a bit of a day.

I'd stayed up a bit later than normal, so I've been fumbling to work through an issue at work, based on remote development access. Whilst I haven't quite figured it out yet, it's definitely something I need to figure out going into next weekend so that I'm able to make solid progress on my real issues. While I don't normally like to work on issues during the weekend, I'll be looking into it over the weekend to see if I can get any ideas, whilst I'm attending [DevFestWi](https://devfestwi.com)!

In terms of personal development early this morning, I worked on making sure that my development environments are set up on my computers, to be able to work with markdown effectively, for this blog, as well as my initiative to improve documentation at work. I'll be sure to loop back on the blog tomorrow, in order to make sure I have good categories and URLs for my regular posts, as well as #100DaysOfCode posts.
