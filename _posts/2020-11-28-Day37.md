Hey ya'll! On the Friday after Thanksgiving, we ate a TON of leftovers, and I got to spent some good time decorating our apartment for Christmas with my wife! I know it's not code-related, but I can't _not_ post a picture, especially since I got to do a lot of the ornament hanging this year...

Beyond that, I got to work on some [linode.com](https://linode.com) changes that I made to save us money, as my wife Ann-Marie and I had previously hosted our personal Wordpress blog on a template wordpress Debian OS server, using the [tuurtell.com](https://tuurtell.com) domain. Previously hosted on its own server, I decided to migrate it to an Ubuntu linode I use for custom development, where I host a variety of other very small sites. You can find the new blog here: [blog.ochsners.us](https://blog.ochsners.us)!

That's all for yesterday - stay tuned for another update later today!
