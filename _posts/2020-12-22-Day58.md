Hey ya'll! Today, I've continued my work with Remote Debugging in Visual Studio, and I've been pushing out a number of changes that I'll be working on through-out the next day. There's not much very worthwhile to report back on, but I will note that I'm really a big fan of IdeaVim for JetBrains' products :)

Other than that, I hope all who are reading this are doing well -- I'll try to make some updates to the blog sometime over the holidays, whether development related or not!

Happy Coding!
