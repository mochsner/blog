So, while this blog definitely still has some work to go, I'm taking some time to setup Google Tag Manager to track links that I post on here.

I got the idea from the other day (Day 11), where I posted about Secret Santa and linked out to [@willy_west_side](https://youtube.com/willywestside) on YouTube. 

Since my Blog has very few readers (it's mostly my wife), I know that linking out to his channel isn't any sort of "promotion" by any means, but I still wanted to have the tracking there, because, well, it's interesting that we can use Google Tag Manager & Google Analytics to track behavior and improve our website!

Do readers click links more when they're written out as URLs, or when they're hidden behind descriptive text? Do you click links more in scenario X vs. Y? There's really no way to know without any tracking =)

If you're interested in setting up Analytics, as well as GTM to associate certain actions (e.g. Link clicking) to share on Analytics, I definitely recommend checking out this post here: [https://www.zoomowl.com/link-click-tracking-using-googleanalytics/](https://www.zoomowl.com/link-click-tracking-using-googleanalytics/)


Happy Coding!
