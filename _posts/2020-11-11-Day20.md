Happy [Veterans Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veterans_Day) Folks!

Today's been a pretty good day for me, as I got to use JetBrains Rider all day, and learned a number of workflows that make my development a bit more efficient (Ctrl+Shift+F` is my favorite, then changed/uncommited files organized by folders is my 2nd favorite). Of course, the best part is definitely ReSharper / quick feedback on issues in the solution (much quicker than Visual Studio), which is helpful for big projects.

For personal development, I've been able to take some time to lock down my [SecretSanta](https://github.com/mochsner/Blazor) application, which now has login functionality using Email, Facebook, Twitter, or Google. 

The setup was pretty straight forward (see my last post with a link to [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/authentication/identity?view=aspnetcore-5.0&tabs=visual-studio)) for the core security functionality, but I had ran into some issues trying to merge my existing database and the existing database, tied to EF migrations.

After fixing the references to use my singular `SecretSantaContext`, I hit a SQL issue:
![](/assets/img/IdentityUserLogin-Error.png)

Which was partially esolved by adding to the below to the `OnConfiguring` function in the `DbContext`:

```bash
base.OnModelCreating(modelBuilder);
```

by leading me to the following error:
![](assets/img/PendingModelChanges-SecretSantaContext.png)

... resolved by running a migration/update from within the SecretSanta project :smiley:

```bash
dotnet ef migrations add MyAuthenticationMigration
dotnet ef database update
```

Anyways, after passing that hurtle, I was easily able to secure the application using tags for my `.razor` pages.

This is what that looks like in code.

```html
<AuthorizedView>
    <Authorized>
        <h1>Hello, logged in user!</h1>
    <Authorized>
    <NotAuthorized>
        <h1>Please log in, anonymous user</h1>
    <NotAuthorized>
</AuthorizeView>
```

Oh, and here's a little teaser of the site!

Happy Coding!
