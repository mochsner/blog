Finally finished "The Pheonix Project" a little over a week ago. Although I haven't read much this year with my customer go-live in April, it was definitely the best book I've read in a while. For comparison, the other books I've read recently consist of Alice in Wonderland, The Martian, and Ready Player One... so maybe I just needed something a bit more technology-focused... who knows.

Overall, I'd definitely recommend the book. Having read <a href="https://read.amazon.com/kp/embed?asin=B002LHRM2O&preview=newtab&linkCode=kpe&ref_=cm_sw_r_kb_dp_umm5CbV2CEJ27">The Goal (by Eliyahu Goldratt)</a> in my Operations Management curricula, it was a very subtle extension into the bottlenecks of dev & IT operations, which are often more diffcult to pinpoint. Although there are many differences between IT & manufacturing, the book makes a good point about eliminating waste through various "principles" and "ways", which I'll be editing this post to expand upon soon :)
