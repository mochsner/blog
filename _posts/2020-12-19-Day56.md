Hey Ya'll! So today, I'm back on and writing my code posts for the past 3 days -- apologies for not doing so sooner. Last week was a bit crazy with a bunch of issues being squeezed in before the holidays, and I was so concerned with meeting deadlines that I may have compromised my own sleep schedule a little bit.

While my "extra time" late at night did help contribute to the specific issues I was working through, I also think they may have contributed to the reasoning behind why it took me so long on Friday to work through a newly arisen Entity Framework migration issue I was having.

It turned out not being related to caching at all, and was more related to the application's configuration itself -- I was able to find out by tracing deep into the SQL connection, but it was a LOT of lost time that I'll unfortunately need to make up for this week and next, when it may be harder to focus (the holidays, or... Christmas and New Years... tend to have that effect).
