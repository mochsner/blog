Hey folks!

This blog top menu nav-bar has been broken for a little bit, so I took the time really quickly today to fix it. There's some bootstrap dependencies I'm not a huge fan of, but it works, and it works pretty well.

Apologies for my lack of updates recently, too. I've been going through some [Interfaces Training](https://github.com/mochsner/fhirTraining) that seems to be eating up a lot of my time. Maybe I'll post about that sometime!

In the meantime, I've also been working a little bit on plug-ins for [obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md), an editor I use. I've got my own published site for Obsidian available [here](https://publish.obsidian.md), but it's encrypted and mostly just for notes I'm sharing with friends. Overall, I've definitely been liking the Obsidian community/toolset so far for my development and personal life workflows!

Happy coding!

Marc
