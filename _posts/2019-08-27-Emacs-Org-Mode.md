<p> Recently, I've been working a lot on my organization strategies. My office mate has been very helpful in getting me the right documentation, but I'll admit that organization is still something I struggle with. In System Administration, it can become a tough balance of not knowing when to write something down vs just doing the task. There's a trade-off of lost time to write something down versus the lost time taken to drop whatever you're doing to refocus on the new task, then spend the time switching back to the previous task after</p>

<p> I know I'm far from having tried everything, but I've switched through a variety of processes to organize myself. In school, I often used calendars or journals, but that doesn't really translate to this. In web development, I've used kanban boards, but the complexity of going live customizations has made that a bit difficult at this time (there's a LOT of different pieces, but I'll definitely revisit this later on).
 At work, I've used OneNote Page tracking, Outlook reminders, Google Keep, Notebooks, Whiteboards, and a combination of all of the above. Outlook is the most preferred by employees I work with, but I'm unfortunately the type to get easily distracted & lose focus on the task I'm writing down if it the program freezes... *cough* Outlook *cough*...</p>

<p> With that, we get to the actual topic of this post, a new strategy I've been trying this week: Emacs Org Mode - a old school, nerdy, somewhat clunky, somewhat elegant tool. So far, I don't have much to say about it other than "it works", but I'll plan to play around with it for the coming month or so, then post again to let you know what I think :)</p>

Godspeed,
Marc
