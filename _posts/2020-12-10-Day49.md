I got to work on some fun issues yesterday with a new framework, that I'm _really_ liking, but also still needing to get used to. It's a great and powerful framework, but the lack of logging isn't quite what I'm used to. Either way, I'm thankful for the opportunity to be able to practice and work on that (being my weakness)

I&#39;m very used to pure JavaScript, with generous use of console.log and debugging. A lot of baked in AngularJS features don&#39;t allow that :(</p>&mdash; Marc Ochsner (he/him) (@moxnr) <a href="https://twitter.com/moxnr/status/1337269712691064835?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 11, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
