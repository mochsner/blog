After deep diving into some complex AngularJS changes, I've decided to get a refresher on the language and "best practices" today. I've started by reading much of the [w3schools angularjs guide](https://www.w3schools.com/angular/default.asp), but am also going to go on to take the Intermediate AngularJS course hosted in Pluralsight.com, as part of the AngularJS [learning path](https://www.pluralsight.com/paths/angular-js).

Whilst I have a decent understanding of AngularJS, I'm working a lot with it and will be making largescale changes that, if scoped out, will need some solid reasoning and confidence that it will be worthwhile.

That's about all I have for today, though, beyond just pushing out a simple fix to the secret santa app at [](https://secretsanta.ochsners.us). Happy coding!
