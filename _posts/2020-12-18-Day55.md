This Friday, I was able to spend a good bit of time at work on an extremely unexpected, and unfortunate, issue at work. Ultimately, I had to try to pull in extra help, but I spent a majority of the day and I still couldn't figure it out.

In looking up and trying to troubleshoot the issue, I wound up learning a lot about SQL caching:
- [](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26048525/invalid-column-name-createdon-using-entityframework-on-windows-azure)
- [](https://dba.stackexchange.com/questions/191788/how-to-clear-the-data-buffer-cache-for-an-azure-sql-database/191795)

This led to the great discovery of a SQL tip of the day, for if I run into this issue down the road:
- [](https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/tip_of_the_day/2016/06/03/sql-tip-of-the-day-clear-the-proc-cache-in-sql-azure/)

At the end of the day, I still hadn't figured it out, but I was able to take some of the rest of the night, and the next day (Saturday) off to sort of refresh, and catch up on sleep lost during the week.
