Happy Friday! 

Today is a big day for me, since a big project I've been working with for my company has finally been Apple store approved! That's right, the "thing" I've been so busy working on and unable post about has finally been pushed through.

It was a very exciting project, and I'm excited to see what sorts of improvements we'll be able to make to it over time. I think what was of particular interest to me was the throwback to use of mathematics such as Calc III and Discrete Mathematics (both of which I loved). It was a really rewarding thing to get to work on.

In terms of next steps for me this week, I've started reading "The Pragmatic Programmer (20th anniversary edition)", and realizing that I really need to get back into my continuous learning habits. In programming, things move so quickly, and you wind up doing better for your company when you take the time to educate yourself and stay versed in more modern technologies - even if they're not in your technology stack. This month, I want to get more in depth with C#, one of the fastest and most efficient programming languages developed by Microsoft. After that, I'll likely go (2) separate routes to improve my knowledge of web development technologies (such as typescript), as well as maybe even starting to improve my knowledge of mathematics :smiley:

Thanks for reading!
