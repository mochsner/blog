Hey Folks!

Today, I got to take about an hour to watch @Shanselman](https://twitter.com/shanselman) and two other Scotts at Microsoft announce the official release of DOTNET 5.0! It's a very exciting time for us .NET developers, since it's the convergence of two separate frameworks/architectures - ASP.NET 4.8, and ASP.NET CORE 4.X.

Beyond #dotNetconf, I also got to take an hour or so to work on the Secret Santa application today, and I've been making great progress on the authentication piece. For .NET Core, there's a million different ways to authenticate, but the easiest way is to just use the native Nuget Package `Microsoft.ASpNetCore.Identity` via `.EntityFrameworkCore` and the `.UI` modules.

These are the packages used by the default projects, which you can deploy by creating an ASP.NET web application, and selecting "Individual Authentication" for the auth:

If you're interested in reading up on it, I definitely recommend the official guide [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/authentication/identity?view=aspnetcore-5.0&tabs=visual-studio).

Happy Coding!
