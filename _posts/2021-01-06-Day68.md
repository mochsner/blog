Hi friends!

Yesterday (Day 68), I spent much of my development time working to get a .NET standard project hooked up to be able to connect to a localhost API, using a .NET development certificate without a root authority. 

In the specific version of .NET, it was a difficult matter trying to find the exact code needed to bypass the certificate check, but I ultimately found the answer I needed [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38138952/bypass-invalid-ssl-certificate-in-net-core):

```csharp
            this.HttpClientHandler.ServerCertificateCustomValidationCallback = (message, cert, chain, errors) => { return true; };  //TODO-MO REM
```

That was really the main part of my day, and helped me to move forward on the project (once I finally got the time).

Happy coding!
