I've been pretty busy today, mostly due to the +2 hour commute from work (I go to the office every once in a while), but I wanted to go ahead and make a post about how important it is to have personal projects in tech. I know there seems to be almost a counter-culture to this idea, since it's not very common in many other professions, but fiddling with technologies at home is both fun, rewarding, and can really prove invaluable for you as an employee as well.

For my personal projects, I've really had a lot of fun getting involved with .NET Blazor to build a (very poorly designed) Secret Santa application recently, and I'm excited to finally be able to work on improving, and maybe even eventually, polishing that design.

In terms of my projects, I'm still *really* hoping to grow my portfolio, but have the following code all available via my [Gitlab](https://github.com/mochsner) or [Github](https://github.com/mochsner) accounts.

- My Blog (this site) - _entirely front-end_
- My Resume site: [https://marc.ochsner.me](https://marc.ochsner.me) - _entirely front-end, static site (meaning no fancy stuff going on with the server running code - it all runs in your browser), but hosted on Ubuntu OS via NGINX_
- My wife and my blog: [https://tuurtell.com](https://tuurtell.com) - soon to be migrated elsewhere - _full-stack hosted on Debian OS through Apache, PHP (Wordpress code), and MariaDB (database)_
- Secret Santa App [Blazor](https://secretsanta.ochsners.us) - _full-stack hosted on Ubuntu through NGINX, C#/.NET (custom code) and SQLite (database)
- Our [Wedding Website](https://ochsners.us) (out-of-date, we're married now... but still a fun app <3) - _full-stack hosted on Ubuntu/NGINX running mostly front-end jQuery, and a little bit of PHP for e-mail/SMTP functionality_


As part of Open-source, I really want to make sure that I'm linking out to the source code of these sites on the *sites themselves*, but I haven't gotten around to doing that. If you're curious, and don't want to poke around my Git accounts to find the sites, feel free to comment below and I'll point you in the right direction! :tada:

Happy Coding!
