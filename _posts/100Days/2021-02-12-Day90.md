Hi all!

It's a great Saturday today, because I'm spending some time working on some blog stuff for our baby. You're welcome to go visit the blog here! [https://adora.ochsners.us](https://adora.ochsners.us)

Today, in working on the family blog, I wanted to figure out how to embed a video (we take many) to native Jekyll markdown, which is rendered as HTML. It looks like it's not really natively possible, but you can get really close by using YouTube to display an image of the video.

```[![Sledding Attempt #2](https://img.youtube.com/vi/_XQO_nWvrA8/1.jpg)](https://youtu.be/_XQO_nWvrA8 "Sledding Attempt #2")```

On my todos for the blog, I'm hoping to be able to look into a good way to format the various clustered lists of images in HTML. I'm thinking about doing something like a carousel in certain contexts, but I first need to figure out how I can use divs or name images when everything is drafted in Markdown (and not HTML).

On the side, I'm also taking a backup of my home PC, so that I can figure out how to dualboot Linux without any risk of losing Data. I'm looking to install [HiveOS](https://hiveos.farm) to passively mine some cryptocurrency (probably ethereum) on my Nvidia GTX 1070!

It's a fun day today. Hope you all are having a great weekend!
