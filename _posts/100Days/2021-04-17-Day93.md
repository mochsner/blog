Hi friends!

So, it's been quite a while since I've posted, but I've still just been doing my thing with development at work, so all that work will DEFINITELY count for Day 93 of code :laughing: 

Outside of work, the main projects I've been working on have involved our daughter, Adora. She's just the sweetest thing, and we document a lot of our moments on a Jekyll based blog located [here](https://adora.ochsners.us). 

It's been a really fun project to work on, particularly because I was able to get an RSS feed to correct format and send emails with all my posts. I'd really love to set that up for this blog as well, so definitely be on the lookout for a feature update like that sometime this year :smiley:

Thanks for reading!

Marc
