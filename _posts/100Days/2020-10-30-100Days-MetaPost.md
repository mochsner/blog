I wanted to take a quick step back from #100DaysOfCode, and really say how much it means to me that Ann-Marie has supported and pushed me to get these posts up. She reads these every day, and whilst they may not always be the highest quality posts, I've really enjoyed the last week of learning, and posting, about my experiences. It means the world to me that she reads these.

The inspiration behind starting this actually came from another milestone that we are _exactly_ 100 days away from today, and I'm excited to be able to share the news about that once the time is right (hopefully tomorrow)!

It goes without saying that blogging about something __every day__ is not easy, but I actually do feel really accomplished for doing this. I hope to be able to continue to keep it up, but also recognize that my wife and I have a number of life events coming up that may lead to lesser quality posts from time to time. Well, that's okay. I started this blog as a way to get myself more acquainted with development, so if I need to focus more on the actual process of learning than blogging (atleast temporarily), the purpose has still been met. At minimum, I'll post about whether I was coding, debugging, or testing on days like that =)
