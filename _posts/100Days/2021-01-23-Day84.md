Yesterday, I spent a good bit of time getting my desktop setup so that I'd be able to practice Xamarin development on a Windows PC. 

My home setup consits of a Windows desktop (custom built, so I'm worried about running Linux on it due to driver issues), and a System76 Linux laptop. It also makes it perfect for being able to work on Windows development (since I can't do that on my laptop).

Specs:

- Windows PC/Desktop
  - CPU: Intel i7 4790k processor @ 4.0 GHz
  - GPU: Nvidia GTX 1070 FTW
  - RAM: 16 GB DDR3
  - Disk: 480 GB SSD

- System76 Laptop (Pop OS)
  - BIOS: Coreboot
  - CPU: Intel i7 10510U @ 1.80 GHz
  - RAM: 16GB DDR4 Sodium Synchronous 2667 MHz
  - Motherboard: Darp6

I've been thinking a bit about upgrades for my computers, since both of my devices have been capped in terms of disk space (and it's hard to justify buying another hard drive for both). I'm wondering if I might be able to upgrade my System76 laptop to a 1 TB harddrive, then use it's harddrive to run my desktop off two SSDs (total 1GB)? Something to look into, for sure!
