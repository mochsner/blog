Hi friends!

Today (Day 69), I had spent a very large chunk of the day working with a coworker on some application API changes he was making, and workign on potential designs and workarounds for him to be able to move forward on the code. The specific pieces I was working on were not at all tied to my own projects as a developer, but I was helping out as I had the appropriate resources to be able to test, and the code he was working on was essential to our business, so I had to flex a little.

Unfortunately, that means that 90% of my day today was spent working on things that did absolutely nothing to contribute to my own work, which I had said that I would have completed by the end of the week. Tomorrow is Friday, and I'll need to report to my managers that the code for this may take a little longer, and flex to be able to get it done ASAP.

Next week, I'll be travelling on-site, which means that development work will likely slow down a little (it's always harder to get things done in the office, given many people to talk to and catch-up, lunches, dinners, etc.). I'll really need to make sure to get things DONE and CRUSH it tomorrow through Monday, so that I don't cause an avalanche effect from my delays, especially with the potential that I may need to take off very soon with our daughter coming, latest Feb 1st, 2021 :smiley:

Happy coding, and wish me luck / pray for me!
