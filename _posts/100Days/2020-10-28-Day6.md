In looking to improve the workflow for cloning remote databases locally, I got to leverage some of my powershell skillz (sorry) to sort of iron out that process. In doing some research on the topic, I found a great open-source library called [dbatools](https://github.com/sqlcollaborative/dbatools/), which seems to be quite the right fit for what I'm looking for.

PowerShell is an incredibly flexible language, and having such portable scripts that are able to do a lot of the heavy lifting for databases can be really practical. In working with databases, security is especially a difficult point, so I've really enjoyed being able to use Powershell where you can store a secure string in a persistent variable (e.g. by running `$cred = get-credential`, entering the password, and using those fields in scripts via $cred.UserName and $cred.Password). This tool is also quite useful for connection strings, which you can store in the .Password field and easily access securely later.

From all the functions available, I've found that I particularly like the following:

- `Connect-DbaInstance`: connect to, and store the connection to, a sql server or database, local or remotely.
- `Backup-DbaDatabase`: backup a database to a fileshare accessible by the SQL server (you can use webpages, such as web blobs).
- `Start-DbaMigration`: copy a sql server and all it's databases (or just a database, dependinging what your connection is to) into another database, using either a Backup/Restore procedure (non-disruptive), or a Detach/reattach (disruptive)
- `Copy-DbaDatabase`: copy a specific database list
