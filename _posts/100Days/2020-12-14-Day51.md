Hi all,

Tonight, I'm learning a hard lesson on procrastination. I've had a thing that I've had to do for a while, but put off over the weekend. Even today, I've sort of shirked focusing on the task at hand, just telling myself "there's not much to it". Well, here I am on Monday night, and sure enough, it's not *quite* as straightforward of a task as I'd expected.

In software development, you really need to _expect_ things to go wrong (because they do), and with that, always plan ahead. If you're putting something off until the last minute, it won't give you the time to be able to escalate the issues to your manager or product owner, to gauge flexibility with deadlines. If you're doing things in the last minute, you may just overburden yourself -- be careful! Either way, I'm hoping to be able to make some progress tonight, and most importantly, make sure that I'm getting enough sleep tonight in order to be able to be fully productive _during the day_ tomorrow!

Happy coding!
