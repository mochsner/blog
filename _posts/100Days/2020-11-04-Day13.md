Today, I got to work a bit in SQL, and learn how to `output` elements of a table after they're being deleted.

In Day 7 and [Day 8]({{ site_url }}/100Days/day8), we talked about the `DELETE` statement, which does an action on some rows of a table. Very useful commands!

Well, to expand on those commands, you may want to output the data you're deleting, as a sort of sanity check to make sure that you only deleted what was expected. Well, how would you do that? 

Turns out, it's pretty simple:

```SQL
DELETE *
OUTPUT DELETED.*
FROM A
WHERE A.ID = 1
```

This can be done with `INSERT` (`INSERTED`) and `UPDATE` (`UPDATED`) statements as well! The trick is just to make sure you have the `OUTPUT` clause right before the `FROM <table>` clause =)
