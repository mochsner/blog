Quick update for today, I was able to make some changes to my blog to start down the road of implementation for categories. I'm finding a category feature to be super necessary for any serious blog, and since the other parts of the site are starting to come together... it's about high time I implement it!

Right now, you should be able to view a list of all the categories assigned to posts (e.g. this one has #100Days and #Tech) automatically! If you click those links, such as the [#100Days]({{ site.url }}/category/100Days) one, it'll take you to a list of all my posts with that category assigned. Currently, it has a preview mode of the posts, but I find it a big messy, so I'm considering making something more like what we see in [/posts]({{site.url}}/posts), without any sort of summary from the post itself.

Cool next things to implement:
- placing all the different categories on a page with a list of the articles they link out to. 
- linking out so "similar" articles at the bottom of existing posts, based on categories

I'm admittedly not very fluent with the Jekyll syntax, but I'm thinking I should be able to get something working based off the existing code I've got. 

Happy coding!
