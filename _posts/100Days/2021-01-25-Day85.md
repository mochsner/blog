Today was a pretty typical day at work. I've been continuing with a number of my normal changes and getting pulled into a few other various issues. I'll be looking at some more technical things tomorrow, so I'm excited for that (though also a little stressed since we're expecting the baby soon!)

In terms of development outside of work, I gave myself the `TODO` today to setup my Kindle to be able to copy highlights easily for the Baby book "On Becoming Babywise" that I'm reading. I've already read it, but I want to be able to read it on Kindle this time, and highlight as I'm doing so for references later on.

I'll be pulling any highlights I take the night prior, and summing them up in a markdown file, where my wife and I can go through and reference things as we're running into it. I'm hoping to be able to define some rough plans for sleep / eat / wake schedules with that as well!

Lastly, I'm currently working to set up Obsidian.md on my Linux laptop, which I frequently use casually towards the end of the day (such as for writing this post). I've been using OneDrive to sync all my notes, but it's a Microsoft product and not really supported by Linux, so I'm looking to use DropBox or something similar at this point - will follow-up on what I go with later in the week!

Happy coding, ya'll!
