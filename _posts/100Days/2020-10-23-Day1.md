Happy Friday!

Today was officially my first of the #100DaysOfCode challenge, and quite honestly it's been a bit of a day.

I've been working through an issue that I can't quite figure out. Whilst progress has stagnated, it's definitely something I need to figure out going into next weekend, so that I'm not sitting and twiddling my thumbs next week.

I would normally discourage working on the weekend, but in cases where you're working with new technologies, it's often worthwhile to be able to openly research that technology at a time where you're in less of a time crunch - the lessened pressure can open your mind to things that will prove more useful down the road, and it often winds up helping you with the issue at hand as well. Of course, to do so... you should also probably enjoy what you're doing :smiley:

In terms of personal development early this morning, I worked on making sure that my development environments are set up on my computers, to be able to work with markdown effectively on this blog with Jekyll Pages. I'll be sure to loop back on the blog tomorrow, in order to make sure I have good categories and URLs for my regular posts, as well as #100DaysOfCode posts.
