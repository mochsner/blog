I had a pretty productive day of coding today! Nothing very notable to report back on, other than noting for myself that I'm SO close to getting a big milestone done that'll help me estimate the timelines left on this particular piece I'm working on. I'm really hoping to get that hurdle done ASAP, so I can better understand and explain where my time should be up until Feb 1st, when the baby's due :smiley:

Besides that, I'm pretty happy with where I am in terms of my technical understanding of C# applications. There'll always be quirks about the language I have to learn, and I'll always need to better myself, but it's nice looking back a few months and seeing how far I've come. While my focus for the near future may be more front-end related (typescript and such), I'm hoping to be able to get into F# (a functional version of C#) sometime soon as well, so that I can really be a productive and well-rounded .NET developer.

Happy coding, ya'll!
