Good morning Folks!

Yesterday was a great day. Clemson and Trump both lost, and I was able to take some time to start to design the back-end to a SecretSanta application in .NET core, which I've really enjoyed working with. Whilst the Integrated Development Environment (IDE) I've been using has been a bit glitchy at times on Linux (JetBrains' Rider), it's been a joy to use their built in Vim emulator, as well as powerful debugger.

In designing the back-end, I was also able to write up functions that automatically clear out, and re-generate tables at runtime, which makes testing a lot easier. I must say, that so far, I've very impressed with the SQLite .NET integration, but I'm curious to see how it'll play out trying to set it up when I need it deployed.

Anyways, I definitely have my work cutout for me today, including:
- Saving any changes in SQL
- Login/Authentication support VS. Email/Communication Functionality
- Creating a form for adding Items

After those high-priority items, I will work on the functions to define how your 'Secret Santa' is determined - likely based on some "custom" rules that negate certain people from getting others (e.g. I'd prefer not to have my wife for secret santa)

Happy Coding!
