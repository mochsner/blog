Today, I've been fortunate enough to be able to take some time to spend with my wife, walk with friends, and Zoom with some of our family. Whilst I didn't spend any notable part of the day actively coding, it was an absolutely fantastic day, even in the tough times of COVID and being unable to eat a Thanksgiving dinner with a group. Life as a programmer is a marathon, not a sprint, so I would never consider taking a break on days like this to be a bad thing.

My wife Ann-Marie and I were able to make a _solid_ first (family) Thanksgiving, including a Cajun turkey (I'm drying out the wishbone as we speak), homemade green bean casserole, homemade mashed potatoes (way too much), cajun-style gravy (from the Turkey), and Sweet Potato pie! Whilst I probably spent a large part of the day stressing out my wife with her pregnancy, I think we did _pretty_ good. I'm proud of us.

Jumping to tomorrow, I'll be looking to be able to kick back, relax and enjoy some hot cinnamon spice tea (my favorite), work on re-designing the [migrated blog](https://blog.ochsners.us) for our family (with a thanksgiving update, of course), and reading up on AngularJS - a technology I really need to learn the ins and outs of to figure out to improve some application efficiencies.

That's all for now - happy coding!
