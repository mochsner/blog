Hi folks, as mentioned in my last post, I'll be taking today to focus mostly on work things, where I'm wrapping up a number of development tasks.

I'll be sure to loop back on this blog later to see if I can get AngularJS working!

P.S. I'm loving being able to post this from my Android.

Happy coding!
