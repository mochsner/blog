After creating a personal blog (<a href="https://tuurtell.com">tuurtell</a>) with my best friend, I've decided to go forward with taking the time to create this site to document some of the things I'm interested in - notably software & technology. I'll still be posting on our shared tuurtell blog, so check it out if you're interested in keeping up with our personal lives; keeping in mind that we're really just posting for ourselves - make sure not to create any expectations for us!

Why am I starting to blog? 

Well, I'm definitely of the opinion that it's important to have an outline where one can create & share their thoughts/perspective on matters. For me, I've been raised to have decent enough writing skills to be able to do so via journalling (& now blogging). With that, I'm excited to finally be taking that effort I've put into things such as reading, journaling & coding to (attempt to) share any ideas I have with others. With that, here's to my first blog post!

Cheers,
Marc
