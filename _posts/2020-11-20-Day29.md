Today's my birthday, and I got to take some time away from my job and work with a friend on some design work for our Secret Santa application that I've deployed (github [here](https://github.com/mochsner/Blazor)!

There's definitely a lot of work to be done in terms of the design, but we made some good progress with it (thanks to [lowerystudios.co](https://lowerystudios.co), and have a good outline of what we want the general page workflow to be.

Cole's illustration here outlines a bit of what we're looking to make the main profile look like, and we'll be divving up the work on the styles end so that we're both able to focus on using our strengths.

Cole (clearly) has some solid experience with design, so he'll be working on how the pictures are displayed (and cropped), whereas I have a sort of web development background that'll make it easier to figure out how to do the text input and field alignment, as well as figuring out how to do a little word list that (though, I'm not really sure how to find out how...)

Anyways, we'll be working on this more tomorrow, so stay tuned!

Happy Coding!
